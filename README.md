virtualhat.py
-------------

Draw names from a virtual hat and email them.


### Usage

Put the names and email addresses of the participants in the `PARTICIPANTS`
dictionary. Names defined in a tuple in `COUPLES` won't draw each other.

Edit the occasion for the draw and the subject and the body for the email
message to your liking, and make sure to set the correct email settings.
